# Project Jupyter Roadmap

The following is a very rough outline of the roadmap for Project Jupyter and IPython.
Historically, we have published major releases every 6-9 months. With our project now
split across many subprojects, we expect to release subprojects separately and more
often.

This roadmap only includes mainline subprojects under the Jupyter
(https://github.com/jupyter) and IPython (https://github.com/ipython) GitHub orgs. We
also have a number of newer, experimental subprojects in the Jupyter Incubator
(https://github.com/jupyter-incubator) organization.

In this roadmap, we refer to the future major releases as follows:

* Next (the next major release)
* Next+1 (the major release after that)
* Future (any release beyond the Next+1)

This reflects the inherent uncertainty in releases that are more than about 1 year away. In
some cases, if progress is made more quickly, features may be moved to earlier releases.

Implement a way for static resources (js, css, images, etc.) to be fetched based on the kernel for use by frontends (notebook, thebe, etc.).
